        <p>

                To celebrate 50 years of Art Metropole, we’re throwing a huge anniversary party!
        </p>

        <p>
                The night begins with the Lucky Draw – all guests who purchase a ticket to the Draw will be guaranteed to go home with an artwork. MC’ed by artist Keith Cole, the Draw determines who gets first pick! Proxy picks are available if you are unable to join the Lucky Draw in-person. 

        </p>

        <p>
                With a Party Ticket, you can come watch the Draw, and enjoy the night of celebration, with a music performance by Moon King, as well as plenty of food, drinks, DJ sets, and dancing.
        </p>
        
        <p>
                In recognition of your support, each ticket will come with a special 50th Anniversary Art Metropole Membership, with a limited edition membership card by artist Alex Turgeon, and a full year of Membership benefits such as shop discounts. All tickets will also receive a tax receipt.
        </p>

                Founded in 1974 by the Canadian artist group General Idea, Art Metropole is a non-profit artist-run centre that publishes, promotes, exhibits, archives, and distributes artists' books, multiples, and related media. We produce exhibitions, talks, readings, and other programs that highlight artists who make books and other artworks that can be widely circulated. Our non-profit shop, which has featured over 16,000 unique inventory items, is an essential service to artists – and is the oldest and longest-running artist-run bookstore in the world.
        </p>

        <p>
                At this critical point in our history, your support will go towards the creation of a fund to sustain Art Metropole over the long term, which will allow us to continue to publish and distribute the work of artists for years to come.
