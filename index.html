In lieu of a traditional auction, we will be hosting a Lucky Draw – all guests who purchase a ticket to the draw will be guaranteed to go home with an artwork. The draw determines who gets first pick! Proxy picks are available if you are unable to join the draw in-person. With a Lucky Draw ticket, you’ll have access to a cocktail hour with an in-person preview of works and a food installation by Forno Cultura, before the Draw and Party begins.

Founded in 1974 by the Canadian artist group General Idea, Art Metropole is a non-profit artist-run centre that publishes, promotes, exhibits, archives, and distributes artists' books, multiples, and related media. We produce exhibitions, talks, readings, and other programs that highlight artists who make books and other artworks that can be widely circulated. Our non-profit shop, which has featured over 16,000 unique inventory items, is an essential service to artists – and is the oldest and longest-running artist-run bookstore in the world.
</p>
<p>
At this critical point in our history, your support will go towards the creation of a fund to sustain Art Metropole over the long term, which will allow us to continue to publish and distribute the work of artists for years to come. 
</p>
<p>
Thank you for supporting Art Metropole!
